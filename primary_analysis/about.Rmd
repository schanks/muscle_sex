## Types of association analyses 
* single nuclei count association with physiological traits, overall and  by cell type  
* snRNA gene expression association with physiological traits by cell type  
* snATAC open chromatin association with physiological traits by cell type  
* bulk mRNA (hg38) and pseudobulk gene expression associations with traits        

## QC for Sarah Hanks' paper on sex     
* Dropping "Muscle_Fiber_Mixed" nuclei    
* Dropping 3 samples: 12004 (non-Finnish), 22011 and 32071 (female NGT first degree relatives of 2 other IGT samples)  
* Dropping samples with < 100 nuclei in RNA or ATAC for proportions and proportion associations  
* Dropping samples with < 100 RNA nuclei for gene expression analyses  
* Dropping samples with < 100 ATAC nuclei for chromatin accessibility analyses

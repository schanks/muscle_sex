We decided to analyze only samples with >10 nuclei in a celltype.

Sarah wanted to know if using the manual glm.nb function instead of DESeq made a difference, as well as median count rather than total count as the offset.  Also looking at power via downsampled datasets.   [4.0_sex_inflatedp](4.0_sex_inflatedp.html)
